# Mean Streets

Data on 268 New York City traffic deaths in 2014.

# Background

In early 2014, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his ["Vision Zero" plan](http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.shtml) to prevent traffic deaths through new policies, enforcement, and educational initiatives.

WNYC's [Transportation Nation](http://www.wnyc.org/section/transportationnation/) and [Data News](http://datanews.tumblr.com/) teams sought to track every death resulting from a New York City traffic collision in 2014.

Data is compiled based on collision reports from the NYPD Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information (DCPI), news reports, and information from the New York City and New York State Departments of Transportation.

`traffic-deaths.csv` includes the following details for each collision, when available:

* Date
* Time
* Location (borough )
* Victim information (name, gender, and age)
* Victim type (pedestrian, driver, cyclist, or passenger)
* Vehicle description
* Incident summary
* Criminal charges filed
* Related news stories
